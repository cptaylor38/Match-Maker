# friendFinder

A small 'friend finder' app that uses express routing and sql. 

The first page prompts you with an enter button, and the second leads you to a survey questionnaire.

Upon submit of the questionnaire, you will be matched with the person who has the closest score to you and a modal will be displayed with an image of your match.
